<!-- ABOUT -->
<section>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Senior Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and operating
            production-grade data systems across FinTech, Insurance, and FMCG domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            My focus is on building data platforms that scale with business growth —
            systems that are reliable, cost-efficient, observable, and easy to evolve
            as requirements change.

<!-- HOW I THINK -->
<section>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>How I Think About Data Engineering</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data platforms should be designed for long-term maintainability, not quick wins.</li>
            <li>Batch vs streaming is a business decision — not a tooling preference.</li>
            <li>Cost, reliability, and observability matter as much as performance.</li>
            <li>Well-modeled data reduces downstream complexity more than any framework.</li>
            <li>I treat data systems as products owned over time, not one-off projects.</li>
        </ul>
